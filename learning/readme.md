Go to 'for_later' for the optimziation and sampling (motor babbling part)
The mat file shows an example of the sampling data (50 Hz sampling frequency)

rnn_2sec.m for learning the forward dynamic model using a recurrent network. Can be replaced with other recurrent architecture like ESN.
opti.m does the nonlinear optimization
evalu.m contains the objective function
